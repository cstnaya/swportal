Sciwork portal
==============

This repository is for the website for the sciwork portal. Check-ins
to the repository will be automatically deployed to the website by
`Netlify <https://www.netlify.com>`__.

The website is built by using `pelican <https://blog.getpelican.com/>`__.  The
flow for contribution is:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run a local devserver
3. Edit the content
4. File a pull request (PR) against ``develop`` branch
5. Resolve discussions in the PR review
6. PR is merged, done

.. note::

  Do NOT file PR against the ``master`` branch.

In the working copy root, run the following command for the local devserver:

.. code-block:: bash

  env SITEURL=http://localhost:8000 make devserver [PORT=8000]

Branch convention
=================

The ``master`` branch is deployed to the official website https://sciwork.dev
and https://swportal.netlify.app.

The ``develop`` branch is deployed to the under development
https://develop--swportal.netlify.app.

Other branches are deployed to https://{branch}--swportal.netlify.app.  Replace
``/`` in the branch name with ``-``.

Pull requests are deployed to
https://deploy-preview-{id}--swportal.netlify.app.  ``{id}`` is the PR ID.

Writing content

Generate Sitemap
-----------------

In order to generate sitemap.xml smoothly, some modifications are necessary:

1. Make sure that env variable ``SITEURL`` has existed.
2. Make sure that each .rst has ``:url:`` and ``:save_as:`` parameters.
3. each time you run ``pelican content`` or ``make html``, ``sitemap.xml`` will be generated automatically.
